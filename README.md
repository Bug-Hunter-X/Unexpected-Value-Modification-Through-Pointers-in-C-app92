This repository demonstrates a common C programming bug involving pointer manipulation. The `bug.c` file contains the erroneous code, leading to unexpected behavior. The `bugSolution.c` file offers a corrected version that avoids the issue.  The bug arises from incorrectly handling pointer arithmetic or dereferencing which can lead to segmentation faults or unexpected behavior. This example highlights the importance of proper pointer management in C.
